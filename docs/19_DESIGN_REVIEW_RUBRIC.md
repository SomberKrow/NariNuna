# Design Review Rubric

**Status:** `ACTIVE`  
**Owns:** Visual/product approval standard for pages, vertical slices, final assets, and release candidates  
**Update trigger:** Product direction, design system, page responsibility, accessibility, or quality threshold changes

## How to use this rubric

Score a complete affected experience, not an isolated hero screenshot. Review ordinary, hover/focus/selected/error/hold states; Nari/Dark/Light; 320/390/768/wide; reduced motion; keyboard; and real final assets where available.

A candidate requires:

- zero hard failures;
- at least **88/100**;
- every phase-specific acceptance gate;
- Jake's explicit visual approval for material art-direction changes;
- Nari's approval for identity/canon/public-content changes.

A high score cannot compensate for a truth, rights, privacy, accessibility, or architectural failure.

## Hard failures

Reject the candidate if it contains any of the following:

- unapproved CatDog/Grim Reaper merge or invented lore;
- copied/hotlinked Nari commission, emote, nail work, franchise, game, or platform artwork;
- generated/stock nails presented as Nari's work;
- private identity, location, contact, family, message, or community data;
- fabricated credential, service, metric, schedule, testimonial, partnership, resource opinion, or contact route;
- support pressure, donor hierarchy, access/ownership implication, or Discord as a global conversion;
- generic VTuber, streamer-neon, link-wall, agency, SaaS, or card-grid template;
- three palette swaps that do not feel like the same physical Haven at different hours;
- giant hero type replacing composition or obscuring final art;
- unreadable art overlay, text baked only into raster art, or hover/motion-gated content;
- broken 320px layout, keyboard path, focus, contrast, zoom, reduced motion, or target sizing;
- autoplay audio/video, surprise adult media, scroll hijacking, strobing, or perpetual decoration;
- collapsed SPA architecture, missing real document, duplicated shell, or unapproved provider lock-in;
- failed required build/test/budget/rights gate without an accepted exception;
- placeholder presented as canonical/final without explicit adoption record.

## Weighted review

### 1. Nari-specific identity and product truth — 20 points

Full score when:

- the page could only belong to Nari;
- streams, nails, community, big-sister warmth, and boundaries are represented accurately;
- canon state is explicit;
- no generic creator language or unsupported claim fills space.

Review questions:

- Would a fan recognize the personality without seeing the name?
- Does the page preserve one identity across multiple rooms?
- Are unknowns honest rather than hidden by polish?

### 2. Haven world and visual authorship — 16 points

Full score when:

- composition, material, light, type, imagery, and rhythm create the late-fall refuge;
- Nari/Dark/Light remain the same world;
- emerald is sparse and meaningful;
- asymmetry feels intentional;
- the result is richer than a palette/theme gimmick.

Review questions:

- Does the space feel inhabited rather than decorated?
- Is warmth balanced by structure and a spine?
- Would the layout remain distinctive with animation off?

### 3. Information hierarchy and user journey — 14 points

Full score when:

- the page job is clear in the first meaningful viewport;
- one primary action leads to a real destination;
- content order matches the page contract;
- progressive disclosure adds context without hiding normal tasks;
- failure/empty states guide honestly.

### 4. Typography and content quality — 10 points

Full score when:

- copy is specific, concise, legible, and appropriate to the voice mode;
- hero type supports rather than replaces composition;
- headings and body rhythm remain readable at mobile/zoom;
- labels name actions/destinations;
- jokes never obscure consent, privacy, money, or safety.

### 5. Assets, craft, and provenance — 12 points

Full score when:

- every visual has a defined narrative job and approved record;
- crops are purpose-built for slot/viewport;
- nail detail is preserved;
- alt/caption/credit are accurate;
- no source master/metadata/privacy leak or repeated lazy crop strategy.

### 6. Responsive composition — 10 points

Full score when:

- mobile and desktop are independently composed;
- 320px and short-height views remain confident;
- order, density, crop, grids, and controls adapt deliberately;
- fixed UI and hero art survive zoom/browser chrome;
- no horizontal page overflow or tiny targets.

### 7. Accessibility and interaction parity — 10 points

Full score when:

- semantics, landmarks, headings, link names, keyboard, focus, contrast, zoom, touch, and screen-reader smoke paths pass;
- reduced motion preserves state/meaning;
- no live-region noise or focus surprise;
- selected/current state is not color-only.

### 8. Motion, performance, privacy, and resilience — 8 points

Full score when:

- motion is restrained, useful, cleaned up, and preference-aware;
- bundle/image/network budgets hold;
- no unapproved third-party script/iframe or client secret;
- remote/image/invite/link failures preserve the user path;
- direct documents, metadata, and host behavior remain correct.

## Page-specific review prompts

### Home

- Is the Haven stronger than the link destinations?
- Are Streams, Nail Studio, and Haven distinct but related?
- Is Twitch primary without making the site a funnel?
- Does final art leave a real copy-safe zone?

### Meet Nari

- Is personality specific without exposing private life?
- Is canon conflict resolved or visibly held?
- Are emerald and heritage meanings personal, restrained, and textual?

### Streams

- Does the page communicate the room before promoting platforms?
- Are selected moments representative, rated, and resilient without thumbnails?
- Is there any tracker/embed/live-status theater?

### Nail Studio

- Does the work look authored rather than commercial stock?
- Are detail, color, labels, credit, and safety scope excellent?
- Could anyone reasonably mistake it for services/client work?

### Haven

- Do values feel lived rather than laminated?
- Does the Discord sequence add meaning rather than friction?
- Is the floorboard extra, discoverable, and accessible?

### Work and Support

- Does professional clarity preserve Nari's voice?
- Are evidence, boundaries, and optionality stronger than conversion?

## Review output

The reviewer records:

- commit/build/deployment reviewed;
- routes/states/viewports/themes/preferences covered;
- hard failures and weighted score;
- screenshots or notes using only public-safe, rights-cleared material;
- exact revisions required;
- approval authority and any unresolved blocker.

“Looks good” is not a design review.

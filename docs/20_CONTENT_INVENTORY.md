# Content Inventory

**Status:** Current implementation mapped; production content partially blocked  
**Owns:** Where public content lives, current record state, source/approval/expiry need, duplication and migration targets  
**Implementation snapshot:** `b65e1c5a6da5a35f4f4f5969465c13f32f277912`  
**Update trigger:** Public copy/data/link/media/page metadata enters, moves, changes, or retires

## Purpose

This inventory prevents content from disappearing into component templates without an owner. It maps current implementation to source, volatility, approval need, and future migration.

It is not a copy dump. Exact public wording remains in source/data and approved content records.

## 2026-08-23 authentic-artwork content delta

Shared authentic identity assets now live in `src/data/artwork.ts`; authentic supplied Prinny derivative references live in `src/data/prinnyCult.ts`; platform shortcuts are rendered through `src/components/ui/SocialDock.vue`. Home now owns a concise desktop-single-viewport arrival rather than the prior long-form Home section inventory below. Meet Nari owns actual model/emote presentation; every remaining page owns its own scene/Ghostie/emote composition while retaining honest content holds. Nine indexable HTML entry documents own Open Graph/Twitter titles, descriptions, and locally hosted preview artwork; secret and 404 documents remain non-indexable and have no promotional previews. All new first-person copy, identity wording, generated support-art adoption, and supplied character/emote/Prinny artwork still require final Nari/rights-holder review before a public release.

## Metadata inventory

Each entry document currently owns title, description, theme color, icons/manifest, and theme boot. Secret/404 own robots intent.

Production additions pending:

- canonical URLs after domain selection;
- rights-cleared Open Graph/social images;
- final route descriptions after content approval;
- any structured data only after claim/privacy review.

Metadata is public content and follows the same approval rules as the page.

| Haven invitation | Template copy | Implemented | Community/Discord final state |
| Professional strip | Template copy | Implemented | Contact/media-kit scope review |

Migration note: gateway data is page-local and genuinely Home-specific. Move it only if another consumer or editorial workflow appears.

## Duplication and drift watchlist

- Twitch appears as a shared constant and also a literal URL in `SiteHeader.vue`; synchronize or centralize if it changes.
- Theme names/colors exist in token CSS, pre-paint script, composable, and control options.
- Route lists exist in Vite, Router, navigation, validator, tests, and docs.
- Selected media appears on Home, Streams, and Stories from one shared array—preserve this single source.
- Placeholder-status wording appears in pages/footer/docs and must retire together.
- Current implemented interfaces and richer target schemas must not be conflated.

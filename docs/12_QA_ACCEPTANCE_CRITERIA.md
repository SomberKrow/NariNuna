# QA and Acceptance Criteria

**Status:** Automated foundation previously recorded as passing; final production matrix incomplete  
**Owns:** Test layers, evidence status, per-route acceptance, release blockers  
**Update trigger:** Any behavior/content changes, evidence is rerun, or release environment changes

## Evidence language

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PASS` | Observed with named method, date, commit, and environment |
| `FAIL` | Observed behavior violates the criterion |
| `PENDING` | Required check not yet performed on the relevant version/environment |
| `BLOCKED` | Check cannot complete without external input or rights/infrastructure |
| `N/A` | Explicitly not applicable, with reason |

Intent, code review, or a previous commit's result is not a current `PASS`.

## Current Phase E client-review evidence — 2026-09-02

The Phase E working tree passed `npm ci` and the full `npm run check` pipeline after Phases A–D. The final Phase E commit adds only the shared-header More/Escape stabilization, its contract assertion, and synchronized evidence documentation; the full gate is rerun on that commit before publication. See `docs/32_PHASE_E_VALIDATION.md` for exact observed counts, route/asset coverage, pending manual viewport and assistive-technology checks, blockers, and rollback boundaries. This is client-review evidence, not production release clearance.

## Historical snapshot

The prior implementation handoff recorded these observations on 2026-08-13 for commit `b65e1c5a6da5a35f4f4f5969465c13f32f277912`:

- `npm run check` passed: lint, TypeScript, four Vitest tests, production build, eleven-document validator.
- Desktop cloud preview at 1363×936 had no horizontal overflow.
- Light theme updated document theme color; Ghostie reveal opened.
- Haven door and floorboard sequence completed; secret route rendered without global shell.
- Secret metadata was `noindex, nofollow`; oath/Rule Eleven interaction completed.
- Cross-document View Transition errors were removed with the feature.

This is retained as historical evidence, not automatically carried forward. The final release record must replace it with current commit/environment evidence.

## Automated repository gate

Run from a clean checkout:

```bash
npm ci
npm run check
```

The gate includes:

- ESLint;
- strict Vue/TypeScript checking;
- Vitest content contracts;
- production MPA build;
- existence/metadata/asset-reference validation for eleven HTML documents.

Current gaps to consider expanding before release:

- exact equality among Vite entries, router records, validator pages, and documented route registry;
- duplicate navigation labels/route names;
- allowed external origins and new-tab rel attributes;
- fixed Nari atmosphere metadata across all eleven documents and absence of stale preference runtime;
- publish-state filtering when target content schemas arrive;
- broken/expired volatile-content checks where automatable;
- generated public image metadata/size budget checks.

## Manual test matrix

Every ordinary route plus secret and 404 must be covered. Use final content/assets.

### Viewports

| Width | Purpose |
|---:|---|
| 320px | Minimum supported reflow |
| 390px | Common narrow mobile composition |
| 768px | Tablet/intermediate layout |
| ≥1280px | Wide desktop hierarchy/crop |

Also test 200% text zoom and 400% page zoom rather than treating fixed widths as accessibility proof.

### Preferences/themes

- Nari atmosphere on every direct-loaded route.
- Historical `dark` or `light` local-storage values do not affect first paint or hydrated state.
- No theme selector or theme-specific keyboard stop is present in the Phase A demo.
- Reduced motion on before load.
- Preference changed while page is open.
- Increased contrast where browser/OS support permits.
- Keyboard-only.
- Screen-reader smoke combination(s) recorded.
- Images blocked/remote thumbnail failed for affected pages.

## Release command sequence

```bash
npm ci
npm run check
npm run preview
```

Then complete the manual matrix and `templates/RELEASE_EVIDENCE_RECORD.md`. Release is blocked by any critical failure, missing rights/canon approval, unknown host behavior, or unreviewed private content.

# Code ownership and maintenance comments

**Reviewed:** 11 September 2026, maintenance branch based on `8c7fe67`.

The 101 baseline code-bearing files and the new reduced-motion regression test have local explanatory coverage. Notes explain responsibility, ordering, failure/cleanup, semantic regions and cascade boundaries; they are not a comment on every line. Existing substantive comments remain. Source-only TS/SCSS comments do not constitute a delivery-size regression; public HTML/vector comments can remain in deployment.

Coverage below records the ownership review and actual annotation location, not a regex-based quality gate. Behavioral risk is checked separately: 23 active templates compile identically; global CSS declarations match the baseline after excluding 59 unused cult groups; nine inline style blocks preserve declaration order. Browser keyboard, visual, network and accessibility review remain pending. Comments must never satisfy a missing implementation accidentally in source-string tests.

| `src/router/scrollBehavior.ts` | active | Restore history before handling fragments; named shelves and the Haven door must remain valid direct-entry destinations. |

| `src/types/content.ts` | active | Types describe current local content, not runtime validation or approved future CMS records. |

| `src/vite-env.d.ts` | active | Keep the Vite ambient triple-slash directive first. |
| `tests/artwork-contract.test.ts` | tooling / regression | Public-art inventory and source-string contracts prevent accidental identity replacement or retired UI restoration; they do not establish visual quality or rights. |
| `tests/artwork-delivery.test.ts` | tooling / regression | Byte/hash and selection contracts protect retained originals and emitted candidates; runtime projection equality rejects stale or oversized metadata. |
| `tests/asset-retention.test.ts` | tooling / regression | Exact hashes protect relocated masters and retired artwork. |
| `tests/chunk-recovery.test.ts` | tooling / regression | Storage doubles exercise one-attempt recovery and denied-storage behavior; no real browser reload is performed. |
| `tests/content-contract.test.ts` | tooling / regression | Local record and source contracts protect route count, safe destinations and content boundaries; no external destination is fetched. |
| `tests/document-contract.test.ts` | tooling / regression | Inspect every real HTML entry and registry to prevent metadata drift and accidental SPA collapse; serving is checked separately. |
| `tests/editorial-rhythm.test.ts` | tooling / regression | Source-level guards retain distinct room compositions and responsive reading rules. |
| `tests/environmental-signatures.test.ts` | tooling / regression | Structural style/source guards protect the room material language. |
| `tests/face-safe-composition.test.ts` | tooling / regression | Source-level crop and silhouette guards preserve intended focal variables; they cannot prove a face remains visible at a particular viewport. |
| `tests/haven-door.test.ts` | tooling / regression | Vue lifecycle hooks and IntersectionObserver are mocked; real refs/computed values exercise knock limits, reset and deferred-image eligibility. |
| `tests/interaction-contract.test.ts` | tooling / regression | Source-level navigation, focus and room-content invariants. |
| `tests/nari-atmosphere-demo.test.ts` | tooling / regression | Check deterministic Nari-only metadata and absence of persisted theme UI. |
| `tests/navigation-scroll.test.ts` | tooling / regression | Exercise fragment, history and ordinary-entry scroll decisions directly; preference mocks do not simulate physical browser motion. |
| `tests/reduced-motion.test.ts` | tooling / regression | Independent consumer lifetime under mocked mount/unmount and media-query events. |
| `tests/responsive-artwork-component.test.ts` | tooling / regression | SSR-rendered markup verifies single-image roots, attribute fallthrough and native picture ordering; network candidate choice requires a browser. |
| `vite.config.ts` | tooling / regression | Build eleven registry-owned HTML entries from pages into dist. |

## Strict formats and retained outputs

| File/family | Owner and update contract |
| --- | --- |
| `package.json` | npm scripts, engine and declared architecture. Document changes in technical architecture; install/audit behavior is explained in README and `.npmrc`. |
| `package-lock.json` | npm-generated exact resolution. Never hand-annotate or edit internals; changes require a focused dependency diff and fresh install/gate/audits. |
| `tsconfig.json` | Strict Vue/TS compile boundary; `vue-tsc` is the acceptance check. No JSON comments. |
| `src/data/projectPages.json` | `vite.config.ts`, Router records, hero-preload generator and document tests. Preserve eleven documents and Support’s existing social-image mapping. |
| `src/data/responsive-artwork.json` | Full integrity record from `prepare-responsive-artwork.py`; tests and validators consume hashes/bytes/settings. Never import it from browser code. |
| `src/data/responsive-artwork.runtime.json` | Compact generated projection from the same operation; keys, dimensions and ordered candidates are compared exactly by Vitest. No notice or provenance is shipped. |
| `src/assets/source/delivery/inventory.json` | Retained asset source path, previous URL and exact hashes. `asset-retention.test.ts` protects every entry. |
| `public/site.webmanifest` | Strict install metadata linked by HTML entries; icons and their sizes must remain synchronized. It does not imply a service worker/offline implementation. |
| `docs/evidence/**/npm-*.json` | Dated npm audit output. Preserve past evidence and create a new dated record; a zero count is time-bound. |
| `public/_headers` | Host-specific URL patterns, with `#` comments. `/*` is the all-path rule; current inline style bindings need the existing CSP allowance. |
| `public/robots.txt` | Crawler policy with supported `#` comments; not access control. |
| `.npmrc`, `.gitignore` | npm/cache/ignored-output intent, with native `#` comments; Python bytecode is explicitly ignored. |
| Raster artwork | Binary bytes remain unchanged; role, retention, crop/alpha and regeneration are documented in the generator and asset records. |

## SVG ownership

All 121 SVGs are retained. The 103 vectors in the streams, nails, resources, work, motifs, states and UI families are imported asset-pack snapshots copied by `prepare-client-assets.sh`. Their pack locations and copy contract are documented at that source boundary; no upstream generator is present in the repository. Do not invent one or annotate every generated shape.

The remaining 18 environment/Prinny vectors have concise local XML maintenance comments, preserving viewBox geometry, IDs, titles and descriptions. Their original generator is unrecorded. The comparison removed comments and normalized only inter-element whitespace; all 121 files retained identical remaining XML. No geometry, color, path, transform, gradient, filter, alpha or accessible text was edited.
